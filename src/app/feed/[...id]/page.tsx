üìñ Overview

ChatDev stands as a virtual software company that operates through various intelligent agents holding
different roles, including Chief Executive Officer , Chief Product Officer , Chief Technology Officer , programmer , reviewer , tester , art designer . These
agents form a multi-agent organizational structure and are united by a mission to "revolutionize the digital world
through programming." The agents within ChatDev collaborate by participating in specialized functional seminars,
including tasks such as designing, coding, testing, and documenting.
The primary objective of ChatDev is to offer an easy-to-use, highly customizable and extendable framework,
which is based on large language models (LLMs) and serves as an ideal scenario for studying collective intelligence.
