          <p className={paragraph}>
            A cookie is a small text file which is sent to the computer or
            mobile device (hereinafter &quot;Device&quot;) by the web server so
            that a website can remember some information about Your browsing
            activity on the website. The cookie collects information relating to
            Your use of the website, information about Your Device such as the
            Device&#39;s internet protocol (IP) address and browser type,
            demographic data and, if You arrived at the Codible Ventures Website
            via a link from third party websites, the URL of the linking page.

          <p className={paragraph}>
            In addition to cookies, the Codible Ventures Website may use web
            beacons. Web beacons allow Us to count the number of users who have
            visited or accessed the Website and to recognize users by accessing
            Our cookies. We may employ web beacons to facilitate Website
            administration and navigation, to track the actions of users of the
            Website, to compile aggregate statistics about Website usage and
            response rates, and to provide an enhanced online experience for
            visitors to the Website. We may also include web beacons in
            HTML-formatted e-mail messages that We send to determine which
            e-mail messages were opened. A web beacon is often invisible because
            it is only 1 x 1 pixel in size with no color. A web beacon can also
            be known as a web bug, 1 by 1 GIF, invisible GIF and tracker GIF.
